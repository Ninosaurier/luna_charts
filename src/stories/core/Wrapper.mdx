# Wrapper

	But don't worry, we'll explain step by step how to get there and take you by the hand.
	If you like, you can click on "Show more" at the top right and see what the source code looks like.
	But you can ignore that for now. Creating a chart with LUNA Charts is like playing with Lego.
	There are a few building blocks that form the heart of a chart. These make it easier for you to insert
	additional blocks, remove them or create your own. The basic structure ensures that the chart does not collapse.

	I'm sure that when you played Lego and wanted to build a house, you always had a thin board on
	which you could build a Lego house. The board formed the foundation and you could place your Lego house anywhere
	in the room with the help of the Lego board. We have something similar. Let me introduce you:
	The <strong>wrapper component</strong>
	<Canvas of={WrapperStory.Empty}/>

At first glance, you see nothing. But this is completely normal. 
Just take a look at the actual source code of the wrapper component below.

```typescript
<script lang="ts">
  import type { Dimension } from "../types/props/Dimension.js";
  import "./luna.scss";

  let {
    dimension = {
      viewBox: {
        minX: 0,
        minY: 0,
        width: 300,
        height: 150
     } 
    } as Dimension
  } = $props();
</script>
<svg 
  viewBox= 
  {
    dimension.viewBox.minX + " " +
    dimension.viewBox.minY + " " +
    dimension.viewBox.width + " " +
    dimension.viewBox.height
  }
