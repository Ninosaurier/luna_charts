	<h1>How to set a title or a description</h1>

	As a beginner in web development, you learn that websites consist of “tags” such as `<body>`, `<h1>` or `<div>`
	and that there are many of them. Some may seem a little outdated or unnecessary, but they are crucial for accessibility!
	People with disabilities are dependent on tags such as `<h1>` or `<li>`. Such tags give the website a structure. 
	People who cannot see, for example, are dependent on such structural things. 
	Imagine you are reading a book, but all the headings, chapters and sub-chapters are invisible. 
	You never know when a new chapter starts and only the screen reader can identify them. 
	Tools such as the screen reader make use of such tags and provide the user with additional information. 
	There are also attributes that support accessibility. But everything step by step. 
	In this chapter we will teach you how to define a title and a description. 
	You will also learn a few more functions that LUNA does for you and that make our diagrams so special!
	Let's begin with a simple bar chart!
	
	<Canvas of={BarChartStory.FullBarChartExample} />
	Looks great, right? By clicking on “Show Code”, you can view the source code. 
	You can see that we have a tag called `<BarChart />` and pass it many different values via its attributes.
	By clicking on “Show Code”, you can view the source code. You can see that we have a tag called `<BarChart />` 
	and pass it many different values via its attributes. At this point we are interested in the attribute `chartInfo`.
	`ChartInfo` is a type that we have created and accepts an object and has 
	members to define a title and a description. The data type is very easy to use. Take a look at the example:

	```ts
	import type { ChartInfo } from "../types/props/ChartInfo.ts";
	import {BarChart} from "../components/BarChart.svelte"

	let chartMeta: ChartInfo = { title: "A title", desc: "A simple description"}

	<BarChart chartInfo={chartMeta}>
	```

At the beginning of the chapter I mentioned that tags like `<h1>` are essential for orientation. Now you're probably 
asking yourself the question: “How can I give the diagram the right heading?” Not at all! The diagram does it for you. 
Our diagrams search the HTML document on their own and adapt themselves accordingly. If it finds a superordinate 
heading `<h2>`, for example, it automatically generates an `<h3>` heading. Well, that's only half the story. 
In reality, the diagram uses WAI-ARIA attributes such as <b>role=“heading”</b> or <b>aria-level=“3”</b>. 
The “aria-level” only serves as an example and is generated automatically using a function. 
<br />
Now that we understand how the title is created, let's move on to the description. 
We have come up with something very special here! In our example, you can see that the “desc” 
attribute accepts an ordinary string. In fact, we are giving you the opportunity to make more out of it here. 
If you want to mark special places or emphasize certain words, you can embed HTML tags in the string. 
These will be recognized and correctly interpreted by the diagram. Here is an example:


<Canvas of={BarChartStory.BasicBarChartWithEmbeddedHTMLDesc} />

As you can see, part of the description is highlighted in bold. This is because you can use HTML tags in the description. 
This allows you to highlight and clarify certain parts of the description. Here is the example code for you.

	```ts
	import type { ChartInfo } from "../types/props/ChartInfo.ts";
	import {BarChart} from "../components/BarChart.svelte"

	let chartMeta: ChartInfo = { 
		title: "A title", 
		desc: "Do you see it? <b>You can use embedded HTML here</b>. Lorem Impsum"
	}

	<BarChart chartInfo={chartMeta}>
	```

So, from now on you just have to think about whether the text is not too long or makes enough sense. 
The diagram takes care of accessibility.
